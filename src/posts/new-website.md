description: With posts and a new color palette!
---
My previous website had my own builder, which was my solution for having modular components that I could use anywhere in the website.
However, the fact that it would not be a good solution for more advanced features, was obvious from the beginning.
Today is the day to fix this with [Svelte](https://svelte.dev)!

# üé® aliernfrog color palette
The colors of the new website represents colors of aliernfrog icon.

# ü©π Fancy & sticky top bar
The top bar you see at the top of each page now has animated gradients.
There's also a smaller sticky top bar when the large top bar is scrolled out of view with a sweet blur effect.

# ‚ÜòÔ∏è Edge-to-edge support for mobile
Yeah that is a thing for websites too. Your mobile navigation bar should no longer overlap website content!

# üóûÔ∏è Posts
The new website has a simple implementation for me to post things like this.
Previous ["Android/data access" article](/posts/android-data-access) is now an actual post visible right on the home page of the website. Old link now redirects to the post.
Expect to see more of these posts soon! ü•≥


Source code of the new website is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/aliernfrog/aliernfrog.github.io).

<font style="opacity: 80%; font-size: 0.8rem;">I also would like to say that the website is currently not very adaptive for wide screens. Will probably get that fixed soon‚Ñ¢</font>
