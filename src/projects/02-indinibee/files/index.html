    Ms. Indinibee (or just Indinibee) is a bee farming themed Discord economy bot.<br>
    <br>
    Currently the bot is pretty simple and does not have much features. Start finding items using <code>/find</code>, sell items you do not need using <code>/shop sell</code>, collect products of your bees using <code>/collect</code> and access shop using <code>/shop view</code>. To get more information about commands, you can use Discord's app launcher.

  <h1>üå•Ô∏è Background</h1>
  <p1>
    Ms. Indinibee was actually created back in 2020 and it had mostly same features with the current one. However, I couldn't find more time to maintain it, after I decided to a progress reset and a rewrite on the "next update‚Ñ¢Ô∏è", eventually I decided to stop the bot.<br>
    It stayed offline since then. Until in 2024, when I finally got more time to continue an outdated rewrite which was created in late 2022.
