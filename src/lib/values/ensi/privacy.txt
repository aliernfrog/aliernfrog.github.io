This privacy policy governs your use of the Discord Application `@Ensi#4062` (with the user ID `696151319819321368`, referred as "Ensi") provided by `aliernfrog` ("we", "us", "our").
<br>
By adding to a Discord Server ("server") or User Profile ("profile"), mentioning in a chat or using commands of (all referred as "interacting with") Ensi, you agree to the [Terms of Service](/ensibot/terms-of-service) ("terms") and this Privacy Policy ("policy").
<br>
If you disagree with any parts of the terms and/or the policy, **stop using Ensi immediately**.

## Information we collect
- **For configurations, preferences and identification purposes;** we may store your Discord User ID and ID of the channel or the server where you interacted with the bot.
- **For chatting feature,** if you specifically mention or reply to Ensi, we may store a part of your message's content (randomly picked from content splitted by " "), these strings are reviewed to make sure we do not store personal or malicious information.
- **To make `/snipe` work,** Ensi temporarily stores the content, author name and avatar URL of the last deleted message (if it is not older than 2 minutes), this data is stored on memory so it gets deleted after a short while, and it can be viewed if someone runs `/snipe` in the same channel in 2 minutes. Servers can opt-out of this by running the command `/server-options`, or `/channel-options` to opt-out/opt-in for a specific channel.

## Children's privacy
We do not aim any of our products or services directly at children under the age of 13 and we do not knowingly collect information about children under 13.

## Opting-out
Your Discord User ID (which is visible to any Discord user), server and channel ID is required for Ensi to function.
<br>
To see how you can opt-out of other optional information collection, please refer to **Information we collect** section above.

## Security of information we store
While we do not store any personal information, we try our best to protect the data we store (stated in **Information we collect** section above). However, we cannot guarantee 100% safety of data as no protection method is 100% safe.
