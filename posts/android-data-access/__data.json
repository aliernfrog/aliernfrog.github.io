However, it was still possible to set the initial URI to specific folders inside this folder and get access to them.\n- In September 2023, a new version of DocumentsUI started rolling out. Which made it impossible to get access to anything inside `Android/data`.\n\n# Solutions\n## Method 1: Custom ROMs\nSome custom ROMs allow users to disable `Android/data` restrictions from DocumentsUI, allowing file explorers to request access to folders and files inside.\n\n## Method 2: Uninstall updates of Files app (temporary, might not work)\nIn some cases, users can uninstall updates of the Files (DocumentsUI) app, and revert to a version which has partial restrictions.\nTo do this: `Device settings > Apps > All apps/Manage apps > Files (the one with the blue icon, name depends on language)` > Uninstall updates`. The app may be hidden from this list by default, in this case look for an option to un-hide system apps.\nNote that these steps may vary depending on your device.\n\n## Method 3: Use [Shizuku](https://shizuku.rikka.app/) with [ZArchiver (proprietary)](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=ru.zdevs.zarchiver)\n[Shizuku](https://shizuku.rikka.app/) is an app which lets other apps elevate their permissions with ADB Wireless Debugging or Root access.\n[ZArchiver](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=ru.zdevs.zarchiver) can be configured to use permissions from Shizuku: `ZArchiver settings > Root > Root type > Shizuku`.\n\n## Method 4: Connect device to a PC with USB or ADB\nAndroid/data can be accessed on a PC when the device is connected via ADB or USB.\nFor USB, selecting \"file management\" option is required after connecting the device.\nFor ADB, commands such as `adb pull` and `adb push` can be used. I do not know if there are GUI apps for this.\n\n# For LAC or Polyfield\n### LAC\n- Use [LAC Tool](https://github.com/aliernfrog/lac-tool), it has Shizuku support.\n- Use in-game community tab to share & download maps.\n- Copy `.txt` link of the map you want to download, and paste it to map name field when creating map. This will download the map.\n- Copy link of the wallpaper you want to use, and paste it on in-game cellphone settings.\n- Manually manage files using the previous methods\n - `Android/data/com.MA.LAC/files/editor` for maps\n - `Android/data/com.MA.LAC/files/wallpapers` for wallpapers\n - `Android/data/com.MA.LAC/files/screenshots` for screenshots\n\n### Polyfield\n- Use [PF Tool](https://github.com/aliernfrog/pf-tool), it has Shizuku support.\n- Download maps from the in-game maps list.\n- Manually manage files using the previous methods\n - `Android/data/com.MA.Polyfield/files/editor` for maps"],"uses":{"params":["slug"]}}]}
