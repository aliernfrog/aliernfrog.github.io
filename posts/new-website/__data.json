Your mobile navigation bar should no longer overlap website content!\n\n# 🗞️ Posts\nThe new website has a simple implementation for me to post things like this.\nPrevious [\"Android/data access\" article](/posts/android-data-access) is now an actual post visible right on the home page of the website. Old link now redirects to the post.\nExpect to see more of these posts soon! 🥳\n\n\nSource code of the new website is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/aliernfrog/aliernfrog.github.io).\n\n\u003Cfont style=\"opacity: 80%; font-size: 0.8rem;\">I also would like to say that the website is currently not very adaptive for wide screens. Will probably get that fixed soon™\u003C/font>"],"uses":{"params":["slug"]}}]}
